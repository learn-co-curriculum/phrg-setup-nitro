# Nitro, Here We Come!

Congratulations on finishing your Rails project. You have learned a lot over the past few months.

Take a moment to pat yourself on the back. Learning the ins & outs of Web Development is not easy. You have put in a lot of time and effort, and have come a long way!

The Nitro Developer team is very excited to see you become a contributing member to Nitro! Fork and clone a local copy of the main Nitro repository in the `powerhome` Github organization. The repo is named `nitro-web`. Your instructor will soon grant you access to the project.
