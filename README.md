# Nitro, Here We Come!

Congratulations on finishing your Rails project. You have learned a lot over the past few months.

Take a moment to pat yourself on the back. Learning the ins & outs of Web Development is not easy. You have put in a lot of time and effort, and have come a long way!

## ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰

The Nitro Developer team is very excited to see you become a contributing member to Nitro! Step one is to fork and clone down a local copy of the main Nitro repository, named `nitro-web`. Your instructor will grant your Github profile access to the project very soon.

## Setup

Once you have a copy locally, you must install the necessary dependencies to get Nitro up and running. We have tried to make this as simple as possible. However, Nitro grows quickly and its dependencies often change. You should anticipate the setup process to run into a number of bumps along the way. Your instructor will help resolve any issues with you as they arise.

## Ready?

From the root of `nitro-web`, run:

```
./setup.sh
```
